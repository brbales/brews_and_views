Homemade beer recipe analysis and recommendation

Initial Objective: A home brew focused application of categorical machine learning to predict style and recommend recipes based on user inputs. Weâ€™d also like it to contain a page that will analyze and visualize trends based on rating data.

Updates: Trend analysis page dropped due to low data quality (inconsistent metrics with no standard temporal relationships). User inputs minimized to better match project scale and timeline.
